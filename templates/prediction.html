    <p class="pb-3 is-size-5">
        Your risk for diabetes increases the older you are. After the age of 
        45, your risk for diabetes increases dramatically. As you get older, 
        your body's insulin resistance increases, which will cause the body's blood sugar to rise.
        People tend to exercise less as they age, which can lead to weight gain, one of the 
        factors that have the most impact on diabetes risk.

    <h1 class="pt-6 is-size-4 has-text-weight-semibold">BMI Risk Factors</h1>
    <p class="pb-3 is-size-5">
        Excess weight is considered the most impactful risk factor for diabetes. Extra visceral 
        fat, fat located around the abdomen, is linked to increased insulin resistance. Visceral fat 
        secretes retinol-binding protein 4, which has been used to predict diabetes and cardiovascular 
        disease in patients. Excess weight usually leads to exercising less often due to increased levels 
        of fatigue and pressure on joints.

    <h1 class="pt-6 is-size-4 has-text-weight-semibold">High Blood Pressure Risk Factors</h1>
    <p class="pb-3 is-size-5">
        High blood pressure is a indicator for diabetes as they share common causes. Both high blood pressure 
        and diabetes can be caused by a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, stress, and insulin resistance. 
        The reduced amount of insulin due to diabetes can result in glucose (blood sugar) accumulating 
        in the bloodstream. Higher levels of blood sugar can damage blood vessels and cause them to harden, 
        which increases blood pressure.

    <h1 class="pt-6 is-size-4 has-text-weight-semibold">Physical Activity Risk Factors</h1>
    <p class="pb-3 is-size-5">
        Exercising at least 150 minutes a week can have profound effects on a person's health. Physical 
        activity can help control weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Physical activity has shown 
        to increase insulin sensitivity which can help counteract the increase in insulin resistance 
        caused by diabetes.
